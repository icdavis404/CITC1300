                    <h2>Primary Objecyives</h2>
                    <p>Primary objectives are the main goal of Helldiver missions. They can range from evacuating
                        civilians to launching a missile. Some primary objectives have parts that must be completed
                        before the main objective can be completed. Upon completion of the primary objective, the
                        Helldivers are able to call in extraction and return to the super destroyer. If the mission
                        clock runs out, the primary objective is failed, stratagems are disabled, and an emergency
                        extration shuttle is dispatched. Most missions are on a 40 minute timer, but a select few have a
                        lower time.</p>
                    <h3>Universal Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Spread Democracy</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with raising flags and destroying enemy
                                structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Conduct Geological Survey</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must first verify the ore vein location and then acquire
                                the soil scan data.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Launch ICBM</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with launching an intercontinental ballistic
                                missile. Before launching it, they must find the launch codes and reactivate the power
                                generator. After this, they are able to raise the missile from its silo and launch it.
                                The missile will detonate in the distance, sending a shockwave over the mission area.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Retrieve Valuable Data</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must collect encrypted hard drives from around the map and
                                carry them to a transmission site. Before transmitting, they must reactivate the power
                                generator.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Blitz: Search and Destroy</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with destroying a certain number of enemy bases
                                (Automaton fabricators, Terminid hives, or Illuminate warp ships). These missions are 12
                                minutes rather than 40.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Emergency Evacuation</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must evacuate civilians from bunkers to an evacuation
                                shuttle. Before evacuating them though, they must establish communication uplinks. After
                                this, they are then able to escort trapped civilians from bunkers to the shuttle bay on
                                the planet.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Retrieve Essential Personnel</h4>
                            <p>This objective is only available during planetary defense campaigns. For this objective,
                                Helldivers must evacuate personnel from bunkers to a shuttle bay. It is very similar to
                                the emergency evacuation, but without the communication uplinks. This mission is on a 15
                                minute timer.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Evacuate High-Value Assets</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must protect rockets while they launch. Enemies will
                                attempt to attack and overrun the complex, preventing the recovery of high value assets.
                                Rockets will launch during this mission, and more enemies will appear after each launch.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Eradicate Missions</h4>
                            <p>This missions are currently only available on the automaton and terminid fronts. The Helldivers must eradicate swarms of enemies. After the set goal is achieved, the Helldivers are able to extract.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Terminid Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Eliminate Missions</h4>
                        <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with eliminating a specific target. These include brood commanders, bile titans, chargers, and impalers. Brood commanders are heavy units that use swarm and rush attacks, and also call upon reinforcements when attacked. Bile titans are massive enemies that spew acid at Helldivers. Chargers charge towards and attempt to crush Helldivers. Impalers are possibly the most dangerous of all; they are massive, heavily armored units that call tentacles from the ground to attack Helldivers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Activate E-710 Pumps</h4>
                        <p>E-710 is the fuel that keeps the Super Earth war machine running. Without it, Super Earth would collapse. For this objective, Helldivers must reactivate a number of E-710 pump stations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Enable E-710 Extraction</h4>
                        <p>Similarly to the afformentioned activate E-710 pumps mission, Helldivers must reactivate a number of E-710 pumps. After this though, they must load the E-710 into a shuttle for it to be transported off-world.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Purge Hatcheries</h4>
                        <p>For this objective, Helldivers must purge terminid hatcheries to prevent the terminids from reproducing. Rampant, unchecked terminid reproduction leads to the spread of terminid spores throughout the galaxy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Nuke Nursery</h4>
                        <p>For this objective, Helldivers must destroy terminid nurseries located deep below ground. They must call in a drill, drill through to the nursery and deploy a nuke to destroy it. The goal of this mission is similar to that of the purge hatcheries mission.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Activate/Deactivate Terminid Control System (TCS)</h4>
                        <p>These missions were available during an operation on the planet Meridia. The goal was to cull the Terminid population on Meridia and allow for resettlement. This objective failed when the gas used by the TCS caused mutations in the local Terminid population. This reulted in the need for the system to be deactivated. During these missions, Helldivers had to wait for towers to charge before engaging. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Deploy Dark Fluid</h4>
                        <p>After the Terminid Control system failed, it as necessary to destroy Meridia to prevent the spread of the terminids to neighboring planets. Mysterious dark fluid was injeceted into the planet until it reached critical mass and collapsed into a black hole.</p>

                    <p>Secondary objectives are optionaly side missions that can be completed to gain more experience or
                        provide a useful tool for the mission. These missions are not necessary to succesfully complete
                        the main objective, but they are extemely useful in doing so. They are also excpetionally
                        helpful in finding more samples or eliminating enemies.</p>
