                    <h2>Primary Objecyives</h2>
                    <p>Primary objectives are the main goal of Helldiver missions. They can range from evacuating
                        civilians to launching a missile. Some primary objectives have parts that must be completed
                        before the main objective can be completed. Upon completion of the primary objective, the
                        Helldivers are able to call in extraction and return to the super destroyer. If the mission
                        clock runs out, the primary objective is failed, stratagems are disabled, and an emergency
                        extration shuttle is dispatched. Most missions are on a 40 minute timer, but a select few have a
                        lower time.</p>

                    <h3>Universal Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Spread Democracy</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with raising flags and destroying enemy
                                structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Conduct Geological Survey</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must first verify the ore vein location and then acquire
                                the soil scan data.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Launch ICBM</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with launching an intercontinental ballistic
                                missile. Before launching it, they must find the launch codes and reactivate the power
                                generator. After this, they are able to raise the missile from its silo and launch it.
                                The missile will detonate in the distance, sending a shockwave over the mission area.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Retrieve Valuable Data</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must collect encrypted hard drives from around the map and
                                carry them to a transmission site. Before transmitting, they must reactivate the power
                                generator.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Blitz: Search and Destroy</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with destroying a certain number of enemy bases
                                (Automaton fabricators, Terminid hives, or Illuminate warp ships). These missions are 12
                                minutes rather than 40.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Emergency Evacuation</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must evacuate civilians from bunkers to an evacuation
                                shuttle. Before evacuating them though, they must establish communication uplinks. After
                                this, they are then able to escort trapped civilians from bunkers to the shuttle bay on
                                the planet.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Retrieve Essential Personnel</h4>
                            <p>This objective is only available during planetary defense campaigns. For this objective,
                                Helldivers must evacuate personnel from bunkers to a shuttle bay. It is very similar to
                                the emergency evacuation, but without the communication uplinks. This mission is on a 15
                                minute timer.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Evacuate High-Value Assets</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must protect rockets while they launch. Enemies will
                                attempt to attack and overrun the complex, preventing the recovery of high value assets.
                                Rockets will launch during this mission, and more enemies will appear after each launch.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Eradicate Missions</h4>
                            <p>This missions are currently only available on the automaton and terminid fronts. The
                                Helldivers must eradicate swarms of enemies. After the set goal is achieved, the
                                Helldivers are able to extract.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h3>Terminid Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Eliminate Missions</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with eliminating a specific target. These
                                include brood commanders, bile titans, chargers, and impalers. Brood commanders are
                                heavy units that use swarm and rush attacks, and also call upon reinforcements when
                                attacked. Bile titans are massive enemies that spew acid at Helldivers. Chargers charge
                                towards and attempt to crush Helldivers. Impalers are possibly the most dangerous of
                                all; they are massive, heavily armored units that call tentacles from the ground to
                                attack Helldivers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Activate E-710 Pumps</h4>
                            <p>E-710 is the fuel that keeps the Super Earth war machine running. Without it, Super Earth
                                would collapse. For this objective, Helldivers must reactivate a number of E-710 pump
                                stations.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Enable E-710 Extraction</h4>
                            <p>Similarly to the afformentioned activate E-710 pumps mission, Helldivers must reactivate
                                a number of E-710 pumps. After this though, they must load the E-710 into a shuttle for
                                it to be transported off-world.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Purge Hatcheries</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must purge terminid hatcheries to prevent the terminids
                                from reproducing. Rampant, unchecked terminid reproduction leads to the spread of
                                terminid spores throughout the galaxy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Nuke Nursery</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers must destroy terminid nurseries located deep below ground.
                                They must call in a drill, drill through to the nursery and deploy a nuke to destroy it.
                                The goal of this mission is similar to that of the purge hatcheries mission.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Activate/Deactivate Terminid Control System (TCS)</h4>
                            <p>These missions were available during an operation on the planet Meridia. The goal was to
                                cull the Terminid population on Meridia and allow for resettlement. This objective
                                failed when the gas used by the TCS caused mutations in the local Terminid population.
                                This reulted in the need for the system to be deactivated. During these missions,
                                Helldivers had to wait for towers to charge before engaging. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Deploy Dark Fluid</h4>
                            <p>After the Terminid Control system failed, it as necessary to destroy Meridia to prevent
                                the spread of the terminids to neighboring planets. Mysterious dark fluid was injeceted
                                into the planet until it reached critical mass and collapsed into a black hole.</p>

                    <h3>Automaton Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Destroy Transmission Network</h4>
                            <p>Helldivers are tasked with destroying antennae located around the mission area in order
                                to inhibit automaton communications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Eliminate Missions</h4>
                            <p>For this objective, Helldivers are tasked with eliminating a specific target. These
                                include devastators, hulks, and factory striders. Devastators are a medium tier enemy
                                with medium armor. They can be difficult to eliminate due to their numbers and the fact
                                some are equipped with rocket launchers. Hulks are large robots that are equipped with
                                weapons from buzzsaws to rockets. Their heavy armor makes them difficult to defeat, but
                                the weakspots on their backs and head can make it much easier. Factory striders are
                                massive walking factories. They are heavily armed, and produce devastators. Typically,
                                heacy ordnance is required for their destruction.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Sabotage Supply Bases</h4>
                            <p>For this mission, Helldivers are tasked with destroying automaton fuel and ammunition
                                depots. They are able to use hellbombs(large bombs that must be manually armed in order
                                to destroy a target) in order to achieve their destruction.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Sabotage Air Base</h4>
                            <p>For this mission, Helldivers must destroy automaton dropships on the grounds and control
                                towers. Most explosive stratagems work to destroy the dropships, but hellbombds are
                                available. Destroying the control tower is trickier, the Helldivers must insert a hard
                                drive into the terminal and activate a number of systems, causing the tower to explode.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Destroy Command Bunkers</h4>
                            <p>For these missions, Helldivers must destroy the automaton command bunkers. These bunkers
                                are heavily armed and armored, so it is dangerous to approach. Turrets on the bunker
                                will target helldivers, inhibiting their approach. Few weapons are able to destroy the
                                bunker, so hellbombes are available.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Neutralize Orbital Defenses</h4>
                            <p>For these missions, Helldivers must destroy the automaton's orbital cannons. Hellbombs
                                are used to fulfill this goal.</p>

                            <p>For this mission, Helldivers must recover the black box from a crashed reconnaisance
                                plane.
                                They must then transport it to a transmission station and transmit its data to the super

                            <p>These missions are similar to the spread democracy missions. Helldivers must raise the
                                flag
                                of Super Earth and destroy Illuminate monoliths.</p>

                            <p>Similar to the eliminate missions for the terminids and automatons, Helldivers must
                                destroy
                                Illuminate harvesters for this missions. Harvesters are massive, three-legged machines
                                equipped with laser weapons and shields. Helldivers must first disable the shield, and
                                then
                                they are able to destroy the harvester itself.</p>

                    <h2>Secondary Objectives</h2>
                    <p>Secondary objectives are optional side missions that can be completed to gain more experience or
                        provide a useful tool for the mission. These missions are not necessary to succesfully complete
                        the main objective, but they are extemely useful in doing so. They are also excpetionally
                        helpful in finding more samples or eliminating enemies. (In this section SEAF refers to the
                        Super Earth Armed Forces)</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h3>Universal Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>SEAF Artillery</h4>
                            <p>This side objective enables artillery that the Helldivers can use to further their
                                mission. The Helldivers must first activate the console, then load shells, and finally
                                enable the connection the the super destroyer. After which, they are able to call in
                                strikes from the artillery using a stratagem. Explosive, smoke, and napalm are just some
                                of the available ammo types.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>LiDAR Station</h4>
                            <p>This side objective shows all points of interest on the map. To complete it, Helldivers
                                must raise the radar dish and align it. This is one of the most useful side objectives
                                available.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>SEAF SAM Site</h4>
                            <p>This side objective is available on the Automaton and Illuminate fronts, and once armed,
                                shoots down enemy ships within its targeting radius. This means that enemies are not
                                able to reach the ground, making it safer for the Helldivers. To complete this
                                objective, the Helldivers must raise the turret and enable its subsystems.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Upload Escape Pod Data</h4>
                            <p>For this side objective, Helldivers must find a crashed escape pod and upload its data.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Destroy Rogue Research Station</h4>
                            <p>For this side objective, Helldivers must destroy a research station that has gone rogue
                                using a hellbomb or other heavy ordnance.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Terminate Illegal Broadcast</h4>
                            <p>For this side objective, Helldivers must destroy a broadcasst tower that is transmitting
                                enemy propaganda. To do so, they can use most explosive grenades and stratagems.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Terminid Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Spore Spewer</h4>
                            <p>Spore spewer are large terminid structures similar in appearance to a mushroom. They emit
                                spores into the air, obscuring vision. To destroy them, Helldivers must use a support
                                weapon such as an autocannon or recoilless rifle to destroy it from a distance.
                                ALternativaly, they can use stratagems up close to destroy it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Stalker Nest</h4>
                            <p>Stalkers are a type of terminid able to go invisible and pounce on Helldivers. They are
                                difficult to deal with, and eliminating their nest should be priority #1. To do so, a
                                Helldiver must throw a grenade into the nest or destroy it with a stratagem. Once the
                                nest is destroyed, stalkers will stop spawning from it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Shrieker Nest</h4>
                            <p>Shriekers are flyinh terminids that swoop down from above to attack helldivers. They are
                                less dangerous than stalkers, but can be overwhelming in large numbers. Their nests are
                                located in groups of three, and can be destroyed similarly to a spore spewer. Recoilles
                                rifles, autocannons and explosive stratagems are very effective.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Retrieve Mutant Larva</h4>
                            <p>For this side objective, Helldivers must recover and extract with a canister containing a
                                mutated terminid larva. Once the canister is picked up, terminids will swarm the
                                Helldiver wearing it in a vain attempt to recover it.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Automaton Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Detector Tower</h4>
                            <p>Detector towers are automaton structures that will scan for Helldivers and upon seeing
                                them,
                                call in reinforcements. To destroy them, Helldivers must use heavy ordnance such as
                                hellbombs or orbital precision strikes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Mortar Emplacement</h4>
                            <p>Mortar emplacements are dangerous objectives that will rain explosive shells down on
                                Helldivers once they are in the targeting radius. To destroy them, Helldivers must use
                                grenades or stratagems in order to destroy the turrets.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Stratagem Jammer</h4>
                            <p>A Stratagem jammer disables all Helldiver stratagems once they are in its radius. They
                                are
                                frustrating structure and can prove to be quite a challenge. Without stratagems,
                                Helldivers
                                must rely on their primary and support weapons to fight their way to the jammer console.
                                Once at the console, they must disable the jammer, after which they can destroy it with
                                a
                                hellbomb.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Anti-Air Emplacement</h4>
                            <p>Anti-air emplacements prevent eagles strike fighters from flying through their targeting
                                radius, and thus disable eagle stratagems within that area. Destroying them is similar
                                to
                                mortar emplacements. Helldivers must use grenades or stratagems in order to destroy the
                                turrets.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Gunship Facility</h4>
                            <p>Gunship facilites produce automaton gunships. These gunships fly high above the
                                battlefield,
                                raining fire upon the Helldivers on the ground. The gunships are difficult to destroy,
                                and
                                Helldivers must use support weapons such as the recoilless rifle or autocannon to do so.
                                The
                                facility can be destroyed using a hellbomb.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Illuminate Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Purge Illuminate</h4>
                            <p>For this side mission, Helldivers must eliminate a certain number of Illuminate
                                overseers. Overseers are well armored and can cause damage to Helldivers easily.
                                Overseers can be eliminated with extended fire, explosives, or stratagems; elevated
                                overseers can also be eliminated by targeting their jetpack..</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Cognitive Disruptor</h4>
                            <p>Cognitive disruptors scramble stratagem codes making it more difficult to call in
                                support. They can be disabled by destroying their power connections. These can be
                                destroyed in nearly any way whether it be a grenade, stratagem, support weapon, or
                                primary weapons.</p>
