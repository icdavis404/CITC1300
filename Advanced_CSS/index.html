            <h2>Game Description</h2>
            <p>Helldivers II is a cooperative online game where players assume the role of the Helldivers, Super Earth's
                elite peacekeeping force. The Helldivers are equipped with a multitude of weaponry, ranging from simple
                firearms to orbital bombardments. Using these tools, they must protect Super Earth on three fronts: the
                Terminid front, the Automaton front and the Illuminate front. The Terminids are an alien species that
                primarily use swarm tactics and acid to overwhelm the Helldivers. The Automatons are a faction of
                robotic dissidents attampting to overthrow the government of Super Earth. Their primary tools against
                the Helldivers are overwhelming firepower and aerial attacks, as well as some swarm tactics. The
                Illuminate, once thought to be extinct, are an alien race that use all manner of attacks against the
                Helldivers: swarms of enemies, aerial units, heavy firepower, cognitive attacks, and more. All of these
                factions share a common goal: to defeat the Helldivers and destroy Super Earth. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Each Helldiver is in command of a super destroyer; this is where they deploy and call in support
                from. Missions are selected from the galactic war map, which shows planets that are under enemy attack
                or occupation, and the operations available for each. At the beginning of each mission, each Helldiver
                selects their weapons and stratagems before dropping to the surface in a hellpod. Stratagems are special weapons and equpiment
                for the Helldivers to use to complete their objective. After deploying to the ground, the Helldivers are
                free to explore and roam the mission area completing the mission or gathering samples and other valuable
                items. Their are primary objectives for the Helldivers to complete, such as evacuating trapped citizens,
                recovering the black box from a crashed recon plane, or launching an intercontinental-ballistic missile.
                In addition to these objectives, there are optional side objectives such as activiating surface-to-air
                missile sites, destroying enemy anti-aircraft guns, or uploading data from a crashed escape pod. Once
                the primary objectives are complete, the Helldivers are able to call in a shuttle for their extraction.
                After calling it in, they must wait for it to land, after which they can board it and return to the
                super destroyer. Missions are constrained by a timer that begins once the Helldivers reach the ground.
                At the end of this timer, stratagems are disabled and an emergency extraction shuttle is deployed
                whether the primary objective has been completed or not.
