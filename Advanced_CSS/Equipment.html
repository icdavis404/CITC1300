            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <p>Armor in Helldivers II is given a protection level of light, medium, or heavy. Light armor provides
                little in the form of protection, but provides for excellent mobility. Heavy armors provide the wearer
                with much more protection, at the cost of speed and endurance. Medium armors provide the wearer with
                both decent mobility and decent protection. Each armor additionally comes with passive abilities that
                further enhance its use. The B-01 Tactical armor is a medium armor equipped with the extra padding
                passive, which increases the armor rating to that of heavy armor. The FS-38 Eradicator armor is a light
                armor with the fortified package, allowing the wearer to more easily control recoil and take less damage
                from explosives. The B-22 Model Citizen armor is a medium armor equipped with democracy protects,
                meaning the wearer has a 50% chance not to die from critical damage and a 0% chance to take damage from
                bleeding. The CE-74 Breaker armor is equipped with the engineering kit, which lessens the effect of
                recoil and increases grenade capacity by 2. The FS-55 Devastator armor is a heavy armor equipped with
                the fortified package, similary to the FS-38 Eradicator.</p>

            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <p>Weapons in Helldivers II are divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and support. Helldivers
                drop onto the planet with a primary and secondary weapon, and can call in support weapons from their
                super destroyer, or alternatively find them at points of interest around the mission area.</p>

            <h3>Primary Weapons</h3>
            <p>There are many types of primary weapons in Helldivers II, such as assault rifles, marksman rifles,
                submachine guns, and shotguns. Each of these types of weapons fulfill an important role and can allow
                for a different type of playstyle. Assault rifles, such as the AR-23 liberator (the standard issue rifle
                for the Helldivers), are all purpose weapons fit for any situation. However, there are many specific
                situations where a different type of weapon
                might serve its user better. Despite this, assault rifles are a solid pick because of their ability to
                operate well in nearly any situation. Marksman rifles, such as the R-63 Diligence, allow the user to
                engage enemies from a longer distance with higher accuracy. These weapons typically have higher damage
                at the cost of capacity and a lower rate of fire. Submachine guns, such as the MP-98 Knight, are similar
                to assault rifles, except they typically have higher rates of fire and lower damage. Despite this, they
                are very useful during missions in which a Helldiver might need to carry a package such as a black box;
                they can be used one-handed meaning the helldiver does not lose access to their primary weapon while
                carrying the package. Shotguns, such as the SG-225 Breaker, excel in close quarters combat, providing
                excellent crowd control. Other types of weapons inlude explosive, flame, and energy weapons.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Secondary Weapons</h3>
            <p>In addition to their Primary weapon, each Helldiver is equipped with a secondary weapon. These sidarms
                can range from melee weapons to flamethrowers, and allow for the Helldiver to have a backup weapon or
                one for specific situations. Handguns such as the P-2 Peacemaker (the standard issue sidearm for the
                Helldivers) or P-113 Verdict provide a backup for when your primary runs out of ammo or your primary is
                innefective at close range. The P-19 Redeemer machine pistol fulfills a similar role. The P-4 Senator
                revolver provides a sidarm that can penetrate heavy armor that your primary may not be able to pierce.
                The CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, SG-22 Bushwacker, and P-72 Crisper provide a means of defeating enemies at
                close range and performing crowd control. The GP-31 Grenade Pistol fires a singular grenade to destroy
                structures or groups of enemies.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Support Weapons</h3>
            <p>Support weapons are the third and final type of weapons available to the Helldivers. They must either be
                called down from the super destroyer or found around the mission area. These weapons allow the
                Helldivers to destroy heavy targets or large crowds much more easily. There are rocket launcers such as
                the GR-8 Recoilles Rifle that are desgined to eliminate heavily armored targets and structures. Weapons
                such as the MG-43 Machine gun and GL-21 Grenade Launcher excel at elimating large crowds or eating away
                at the armor of some mid-level units. The FLAM-40 flamethrower is an exceptional crowd control and area
                denail tool. The RS-422 Railgun and APW-1 Anti-Materiel Rifle excel at eliminating any target, but
                require shots to be highly accurate to enemy weakpoints.</p>

            <h2>Stratagems</h2>
            <p>Stratagems are arguabuably the most powerful and important tool in the Helldivers arsenal. Ranging from
                oribtal strikes and eairstrikes to exosuits, these abilities proivde the additional firepower and
                abilities the Helldivers need to achieve victory on the battlefield. Each Helldiver has 4 stratagem
                slots to take on each mission. Support weapons and backpacks are stratagems that the Helldivers take
                with to use themselves. Oribital bombardments such as the 380mm high explosive barrage deal large
                amounts of damage over a wide area, destroying enemies and structures alike. Airstrikes provide fast,
                close support to deal with enemies. Strikes can range from the 500kg bomb that deals high damage in a
                large area, to the cluster strike that deals lower damage over a larger area. Sentry turrets provide
                autonomous support for the Helldivers, eliminating enemies without input. Vehicle stratagems such as the
                EXO-45 Patriot exosuit or M-102 can provide additional firepower or mobility for the Helldivers. </p>
