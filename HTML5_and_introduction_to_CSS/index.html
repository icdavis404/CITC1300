            <h2>Overview of the Apollo Space Program</h2>

            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The Apollo Space Program, led by NASA, achieved the first manned landing on the moon's surface. There
                were a total of 15 missions, 12 of which were crewed. The three uncrewed missions were used to test the
                technologies for the program and ensure crew safety. Two of the 11 crewed missions ended in disaster.
                During a preflight test, a fire broke out in the Apollo 1 command module, resulting in the death of the
                entire crew of three. During the Apollo 13 mission, an oxygen tank exploded while en route to the moon;
                luckily, the spacecraft was able to return to Earth and the crew survived. The remaining 10 missions
                succeeded in their goals, with six of them landing a total of 12 men on the moon.

            <h3>Program Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The primary goal of the Apollo Program, as set out by President John F. Kennedy, was to place a man on
                the moon by the end of the 1960's. At Rice University in Houston, Texas, John F. Kennedy said "We choose
                to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they
                are hard." Although he did not live to see the moon landing, it is indisputable that his efforts to
                achieve it had a large impact on the lunar program. Landing on the moon was an important part of winning
                the space race against, and asserting technological dominance upon the Soviet Union. The United States
                had few victories against the Soviet Union during the Space Race, but the lunar landing was a decisive
                victory in the race. A final note on he goals of the Apollo Program was that it was intended to advance
                technology and further our understanding of what lies beyond Earth.
