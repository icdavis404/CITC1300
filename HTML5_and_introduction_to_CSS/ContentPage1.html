            <h3>Vehicle Information</h3>
            <p>
                The first stage of the Saturn V rocket was powered by five Rocketdyne F-1 engines producing upwards of
                1.5 million pounds of thrust each. The second stage was powered by five Rocketdyne J-2 engines producing
                upwards of 232,250 pounds of thrust each. The third stage was powered by a single J-2 engine. The rocket
                was controlled by the Apollo instrument unit. This 6.6 meter ring contained the guidance system for the
                rocket.

                Above the instrument unit was the fairing containing the lunar module. The lunar module was made up of
                two parts: the descent stage and the ascent stage. The descent stage contained an engine, the landing
                legs, and some of the scientific instruments for the mission on the lunar surface. The ascent stage
                broke away from the descent stage for the return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the command module.

                Above the lunar module was the service module. This module contained the engine, fuel and electrical
                systems for the spacecraft. Below this, was the fairing containing the lunar module.

                The crew sat in the command module at launch. The command module sat atop the rocket at launch, and also
                contained the heat shield for atmospheric reentry and the parachutes for landing. Only the launch escape
                system was above it; in the event of an emergency during launch or atmospheric flight, a solid rocket
                motor would ignite and pull the command module away from the rest of the rocket.

            <h3>Mission Profile</h3>
            <p>
                The apollo missions took off from the Cape Canaveral launch complex in Florida. The first stage would
                propel the rocket through the thickest parts of the atmosphere. As the rocket gained vertical speed, it
                would begin to roll in order to gain horizontal speed and reach orbit. After the first stage used used
                all of its fuel, it was dropped and the second stage ignited. This stage would propel it nearly in to
                orbit, with only a small burn from the third stage to achieve a stable orbit around the Earth. Next, the
                third stage would reignite to propel the rocket towards the moon. After this burn was complete, the
                fairing around the lunar module would be deployed and the rocket would reconfigure. The command and
                service module would flip around and dock with the lunar module. As the rocket reached the moon, the
                service module's engine was used to slow the rocket down into a lunar orbit. After the modules were in
                lunar orbit, two astronauts would board the lunar module while one would stay abourd the command module.
                The two modules would undock, and the lunar module would begin its descent to the surface of the moon.
                The descent stage was used to slow the lander down as it approached the surface. After landing, various
                activities were completed such as driving around the surface using the lunar rover, various scientific
                experiments, or even hitting golf balls. After their time on the surface was over, the astronauts would
                reboard the lander, and lift off using the ascent stage; the descent stages were left behind on the
                surface of the moon and remain there today. After redocking with the command module and reboarding the
                command module, the ascent stage was dumped and the transearth injection burn was completed. After
                returing to orbit around the Earth, a final burn would be completed to decay the spacecrafts orbit below
                into the atmosphere. The service module would be jettisoned, and the heat shield would protect the
                command module from the heat of atmospheric reentry. Once the command module had gone through much of
                the atmosphere, the parachutes were deployed and the heat shield jettisoned. The command module would
                splash down in the ocean and be recovered by navy vessels.
