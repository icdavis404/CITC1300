                    <p>The Terminids are a species of bug-like creatures that attempt to spread by any means necessary.
                        Throughout the Second Galactic War, new variants have evolved making them a more formidable
                        adversary. The lowest level of Terminids sucha as the scavengers and pouncers swarm helldivers
                        and attempt to overrun them. Scavengers are small bugs that will attack helldivers with their
                        claws in large numbers. Pouncers are similar, except they have increased agility when compared
                        to scavenegrs. Medium bugs such as warriors and hive guards are bulkier, meaning they are more
                        resilient to the attacks of helldivers. Warriors are larger bugs that have better armor and will
                        attack similarly to scavengers. Hive guards have an armored front, meaning bullets from most
                        guns will ricochet off. Helldivers must aim in between the armor or flank them. Heavy Terminids
                        such as chargers or brood commanders. are heavily armored, and helldivers will likely need to
                        use support weapons to eliminate them. Chargers are large bugs with heavy armor impervious to
                        nearly all weapons. Only explosives or shots to their soft underbelly can defeat them. Brood
                        commanders are larger, more heavily armored versions of warriors. They will charge and stun
                        helldivers, and are resilient against all attacks, so they can be difficult to defeat. Elite
                        Terminids such as bile titans and impalers are massive enemies. Bile titans are tall bugs that
                        spew acid at Helldivers. They are heavily armored and out of reach of some weapons due to their
                        height. Impalers are massive creatures that call tentacels from the ground that attack
                        Helldivers. Elite enemies require heavy ordnance in order to defeat them. Screechers are flying
                        enemies that will swoop down upon Helldivers in large swarms. They are fragile, but their speed
                        and numbers can make them difficult to defeat.

                        The Terminids are farmed in order to provide the E-710 Super Earth needs as fuel. They are a
                        formidable enemy that will stop at nothing to destroy Super Earth. </p>

                    <p>The Automaton Legion are a group of rogue robots set on destroying Super Earth. They are
                        descended from teh cyborgs that endangered Super Earth during the First Galactic War. Low-level
                        enemies such as troopers and Commissars will fire upon Helldivers with laser weapons, sometimes
                        using mounted laser cannons. Comissars are especially dangerous because they can call in
                        reinforcements on their location using a flare. Scout striders are troopers riding on a walker;
                        they are dangerous from the front due to their frontal armor and laser cannons, but are
                        vulnerable from the sides and rear. Berserkers are mid-level Automatons with chainsaws for arms.
                        They are resilient and very dangerous at close range. Devastators are mid-level Autaomatons with
                        medium armor, meaning many weapons can not damage them. They primarily use laser weapons,
                        however some versions are equipped with rockets or shields. Hulks are large, heavily armed
                        robots equipped with a variety of weapons. They are impervious to most fire, however they have a
                        number of weakpoints that can be exploited by Helldivers. The Automatons have a number of tanks
                        that are heavily armed and armored. They can be equipped with heavy cannons, multi-barreled
                        machine guns, and multiple-launch rocket systems. Automaton gunships fly high above helldivers
                        and fire at them with machine guns and rockets. Their armor and distance make them formidable
                        enemies. The Automatons can also have a number of weapons emplacements such as mortars or
                        ani-aircraft guns.</p>

                    <p>The Illuminate are an ancient, highky advanced alien race set on invading and destroying
                        Super
                        Earth. They were repelled during the First Galactic War, but they returned to challenge the
                        might of Super Earth and the Helldivers once again. The voteless are a low-level enemy made
                        up
                        of former citizens of Super Earth that have been taken over by the Illuminate's mind
                        control.
                        They will attack helldivers in large swarms, running and leaping at them. Unfortunately,
                        they
                        are too far gone under the Illuminate's mind control and there is no way to save them.
                        Overseers
                        and elevated overseers are squid-like creatures that will use laser weapons and explosives
                        against the Helldivers. Elevated overseers are equipped with jetpacks that allow them to
                        stay
                        far away from Helldivers, but present a weak point to be exploited. Watchers are flying
                        drones
                        that can attack helldivers, but their primary danger is that they are able to call in
                        Illuminate
                        reinforcements. Harvesters are large tri-pedal robots equipped with shield generators and
                        laser
                        beam weapons.</p>
